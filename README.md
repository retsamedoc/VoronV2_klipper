This repo based on f0or1s' [cr10_klipper repo](http://github.com/fl0r1s/cr10_klipper), rpanfili's [woron-ht repo](http://github.com/rpanfili/voron-ht), and Zellneralex's [klipper_config repo](http://github.com/zellneralex/klipper_config) among many others.
It is a work in progress as I keept finding new and better ways to organize/tune my setup.
